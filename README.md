# GraphVisual

### Components of GUI

The GUI has the following 5 important components:

1. Image panel - This Panel contains the final output graph. I have used JUNG (Java universal network generator) for visualizing these graphs.

2. Timeline panel - This contains the timeline bars with the timeline controls which help you to navigate and view the graphs of different dates according to will.

3. Toolbar - The left side toolbar contains tools like drag and drop vertices, move and rotate, exporting images and edge list.

4. Category Panel - This contains the tools for selecting the mode for finding relations betIen users and setting the corresponding thresholds.

5. Notes Pane - Helps you to maintain notes for the currently vieId graph and thus continue ymy analysis later on.
